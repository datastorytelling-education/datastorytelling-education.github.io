This half-day workshop is organised as follows:

## Welcome and contextualisation: 30 minutes

In the first activity of this workshop, the organisers will introduce current explorations of GenAI in crafting DS in LA and other research fields such as InfoVis and HCI. The motivation of this activity is 
to broaden participants’ understanding of Human-AI collaborations for crafting DS in education and draw on inspirations from similar endeavours in other contexts.

## Hands-on exploration of GenAI and its current uses for DS: 1.5 hours 

Participants will engage in a hands-on activity, exploring the uses of GenAI across all stages of DS –analysis, planning, implementation, and communication (Li et al., 2024)–, and human-centred approaches to 
designing data stories. The activity will focus on how GenAI can be integrated into each stage to craft and design data stories for educational purposes. The organisers will provide examples and current 
practices of GenAI applications for crafting DS and encourage participants to apply these insights to their own domains, envisioning potential Human-GenAI collaborations for designing and creating data 
stories.

## Working groups: 1 hour

After the hands-on activity, participants will engage in small group discussions to share their perceptions, motivations, and insights on the challenges and opportunities they foresee in the current 
capabilities of GenAI and its implications for DS research in LA. During this discussion, participants will reflect on the use of GenAI at various stages of crafting data stories and will discuss 
considerations and recommendations for future design practices and applications of GenAI in educational data storytelling.

## Wrap-up and conclusions: 30 minutes

The workshop will conclude with a summary of key insights from the hands-on activities and group discussions, highlighting critical takeaways and future directions for exploring GenAI in educational data 
storytelling. 


## Intended outcomes

Participants attending the workshop will gain: (i) deep insights into GenAI’s role in crafting DS; (ii) practical experience with GenAI tools through hands-on activities to craft DS; (iii) a critical 
perspective on the opportunities and challenges of using GenAI for the design and automation of DS; (iv) and the chance to collaborate with DS experts in LA and practitioners to explore the future of DS in 
the GenAI era.
