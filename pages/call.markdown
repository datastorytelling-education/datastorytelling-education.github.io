## Call for papers

This workshop aims to explore methodological (formal and practical) approaches to actively increase 
DS adoption and impact in the LA community. Thus, this workshop will provide a scenario for 
participants to reflect and critically discuss the following aspects:  What methods and 
methodologies of DS from other domains are suitable for LA? How can researchers effectively 
evaluate the impact of DS in LA? How can we automate the process of generating fair and unbiased 
data stories? To start, the organisers of the workshop will provide a review of lessons learnt from 
using DS to support stakeholders’ interpretations of visual interfaces from the current literature 
in LA and other research fields such as Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI). This review will be a starting point to open the discussion with participants 
regarding challenges (e.g., automate DS according to particular needs) and opportunities (e.g., the 
use of AI to generate narratives to support interpretations) of DS to effectively support 
educational stakeholders to make sense of their data traces and make them actionable to improve 
their practice.

## Topics of interest

Researchers are invited to submit their data storytelling work, including case studies, interactive visualisations, and narrative-driven stories.

- Data storytelling for impact: How can data storytelling be used to communicate learning insights and inform students/teachers actions?
- Developing and evaluating methods and methodologies of data storytelling: What are the most effective ways to tell learning/teaching stories with data?
- Evaluating and measuring the impact of data storytelling approaches on learning outcomes: How can we measure the effectiveness of data storytelling in different learning contexts?
- Designing and implementing automated data storytelling tools and techniques: Can we develop tools and techniques to automate the process of creating learning/teaching stories?
- Addressing bias and fairness in data storytelling approaches: How can we ensure that learning/teaching stories are fair and accurate representations of reality?

This list is not exhaustive, and we encourage you to submit your ideas for other data storytelling topics.
