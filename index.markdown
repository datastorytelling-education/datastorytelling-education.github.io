## DS-LAK25 - AI-assisted Data Storytelling in Education:Tools, Methods and Future Practices

**Where**: LAK25 Conference, Dublin, Ireland

**When**: Tuesday, March 4, 2024, from 9:00am to 12:30pm

**Registration opens soon**: [LAK24 Web page](https://www.solaresearch.org/events/lak/lak25/)

### Workshop abstract:

Data Storytelling (DS) in education has provided tools and methods to support data experts to make stories more accessible to non-data experts (i.e., learners, educators, and professional staff) while also 
allowing data savvy stakeholders (i.e., researchers), using human-centred approaches, in the creation process.  With the rise of Generative AI (GenAI), interest has grown in exploring its potential to 
automate the process of creating effective data stories, as this is often a time-consuming task. This workshop seeks to foster critical discussion and hands-on activities around the opportunities and 
challenges of integrating GenAI tools and methods into DS in educational contexts. Key topics for exploration include: (i) How can GenAI be integrated into DS stages (analysis, planning, implementation, and 
communication) to automate the generation of actionable data stories that improve teaching and learning outcomes? (ii) How can researchers, designers, and educational stakeholders adapt and adopt GenAI tools 
and produce meaningful learning and teaching stories? (iii) What challenges and risks arise from including GenAI in DS stages? This workshop aims to bring together experts in storytelling and GenAI within the 
LA community to discuss and shape the future of DS in LA, addressing both its challenges and opportunities.

### Motivation and Background

In recent years, the Learning Analytics (LA) community has embraced new methods from Human-centred Interaction (HCI) and Information Visualisation (InfoVis) communities, such as the adoption of Data 
Storytelling (DS) in LA interfaces (e.g., Maheshi et al., 2024; Fernandez-Nieto et al., 2024). DS, which incorporates narratives, visual elements, and storytelling techniques in large and complex data, aims 
to support and guide the 
interpretation and communication of 
educational insights to non-data experts stakeholders (i.e., students and teachers) (Ryan, 2016). 

The current GenAI’s capabilities to process, generate, and combine together diverse data types (e.g., datasets, text, images, audio) have enabled a human-AI partnership to support humans in diverse and 
complex tasks. While recent studies have begun to explore AI-assisted automation of crafting data stories to enhance accessibility and scalability (Li et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024), this 
remains a nascent area of empirical research. Given the limited work in this field, this workshop seeks to explore how GenAI can support various stages of Data Storytelling, including analysis, planning, 
implementation, and communication (Li et al., 2024) to support teaching and learning. Specifically, this workshop will explore benefits and challenges of using GenAI as a design material during the DS 
creation with stakeholders, and GenAI-enabled authoring tools for crafting data stories, uncovering topics such as overreliance, trust, human and AI roles, bias mitigation and impact on learning.

The workshop will provide participants with a space to reflect on and critically discuss the following aspects: How can GenAI be integrated into DS stages? How can researchers and practitioners adapt and 
adopt GenAI tools to produce meaningful learning data stories? What are the challenges and risks of relying on AI-assisted data stories? To begin, the organisers will present a review of seminal work (tools, 
techniques, empirical results) on using GenAI to automatically craft data stories in LA and other fields, such as InfoVis and HCI. This review will serve as a starting point for discussions on the 
opportunities, challenges, and risks of using GenAI to automate DS, focusing on how these stories can help educational stakeholders make sense of data traces and take actionable steps to improve their 
practices.
